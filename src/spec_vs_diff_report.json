  "summary": "The implementation covers most requirements with good fidelity to the BuildRequest. Core backend event storage with CRUD operations, frontend views (Calendar with monthly/weekly/daily views, Add/Edit Event, Event Details), theme support, bottom navigation, and notification system are all present. However, there are several gaps: the backend does not use stable storage (no stable variables for persistence across upgrades), the Home screen is missing (only referenced in routing but file not shown), the Settings screen is missing (only referenced in routing), and some styling and animation details may need verification in the truncated files.",

      "reason": "The backend/main.mo uses Map.empty<Text, Event>() which creates a regular (non-stable) variable. No stable variable declarations are present, meaning events will not persist across canister upgrades.",
