# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a modern mobile calendar application with event management, multiple calendar views, reminder notifications, and dark/light mode support.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement backend event storage in Motoko with stable storage for CRUD operations (title, date, time, description, reminder flag)
- Create Home screen displaying today's date and events
- Build monthly calendar view with event indicators and month navigation
- Implement daily and weekly calendar views
- Create Add Event form with date/time pickers and validation
- Build Event Details page with edit and delete functionality
- Implement browser-based reminder notification system (15 minutes before events)
- Add dark mode and light mode support with theme toggle
- Create bottom navigation bar (Home, Calendar, Add Event, Settings tabs)
- Build Settings screen with theme toggle and notification preferences
- Apply smooth animations throughout the app using Tailwind CSS
- Ensure mobile-responsive design optimized for Android devices
- Style with minimal, professional design using blue, white, and purple colors

**User-visible outcome:** Users can manage calendar events through an intuitive mobile interface with multiple view options (daily, weekly, monthly), receive reminder notifications, switch between dark and light themes, and access all features through a clean bottom navigation.
